        <h3>
            Technology is the present not the future 
    </h3>
    <p>
        As a software developer, as a Programmer and most importantly as a human being, <br/>
        I want to to tell you that technology is not just AI and that we don't only have to <br />
        look at the negative side such as machine learning and artificial intelligence overruling <br/>
        humans but we must also look at the positive side. Technology has no age limit, no prerequisites,<br/> 
        it is often used for healthcare anyone can learn "even a 5 year old". It has made it easier for economies <br>
        to grow, for people to learn and travel. Technology should not just be the future it should also be the present. <br/>
